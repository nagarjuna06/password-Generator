# password-Generator
This program can be used to generate passwords. By default it generates ten passwords with a length of 32 characters each, drawing from lower-case and upper-case characters, as well as numbers.

You can choose what character sets to use. You can also provide a custom set of characters. The length and number of passwords can be changed, too.
